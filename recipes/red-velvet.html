        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat Oven: Set your oven to 325°F (163°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans and set aside.</li>
            <li>Mix Dry Ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cocoa powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine Wet Ingredients: In a large bowl, combine the sugar and vegetable oil. Mix in the eggs, buttermilk, vanilla extract, and red food coloring until well combined.</li>
            <li>Incorporate Dry Ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
            <li>Add Coffee and Vinegar: Stir in the brewed coffee and white vinegar until the batter is smooth.</li>
            <li>Bake: Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Cool: Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes, then remove them from the pans and let them cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
            <li>Frost: Once the cakes are completely cooled, frost with your favorite cream cheese frosting.</li>
