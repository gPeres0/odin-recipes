        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Brazilian Strogonoff, known locally as "Estrogonofe," is a beloved dish in Brazil, distinct from its Russian origins. 
            It features a creamy, tomato-based sauce and is commonly made with either beef or chicken. The dish is typically 
            served over white rice and often accompanied by french fries, adding a delightful crunch to the meal.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1½ pounds (approximately 680 grams) skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms (optional)</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sauté Aromatics: In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until translucent. Add the minced garlic and sauté briefly until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Cook Chicken: Add the chicken pieces to the skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until the chicken is browned on all sides and fully cooked through.</li>
            <li>Add Mushrooms: If using mushrooms, add them to the skillet and cook until they soften.</li>
            <li>Prepare Sauce: Stir in the tomato sauce, ketchup, and Dijon mustard. Mix well to combine. Let the mixture simmer gently for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li>Incorporate Cream: Reduce the heat to low and stir in the heavy cream. Cook for a few more minutes until the sauce is heated through and reaches your desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Serve: Garnish with chopped fresh parsley. Serve the stroganoff over white rice and accompany it with crispy french fries for an authentic Brazilian experience.</li>
        </ul>
